#Tlib doesn't concern about this module being integrated in other
#librarie/programming language!

#Tlib.py is a module that consists of speed and easy usage of the following
#libraries

"""
Tlib.py was first created on March of 2022, its an on-developing module made by
Tom√°s Pereira | IMPORTANT: NO DISTRIBUTIONS OF THIS MODULE ALLOWED! | The positions
of screen widgets/objects start at (0, 0)X and Y, use of strings aren't required on
functions but apreciated!
